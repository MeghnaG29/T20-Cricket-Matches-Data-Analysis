# T20-Cricket-Matches-Data-Analysis

Twenty20 (T20) is a shortened format of cricket. At the professional level, it was introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 2003 for the inter-county competition. The game has succeeded in spreading around the cricket world. Women's and men's Twenty20 Internationals have been played since 2004 and 2005 respectively. To date, 76 nations have played the format, including all Test-playing nations.

In this project, we will use our data manipulation and visualization skills to explore patterns and trends of menâ€™s T20 matches till date. We will try to find out answers to various questions like: Which team played the maximum number of matches? Which country won the trophy most often? Is there any correlation between number of matches played and the number of victories at the home ground?
